# Security updates are automatically enabled for all ecosystems
# Dependabot will create PRs for security updates with high priority
# Security updates ignore the schedule and are created immediately

# Additional notes:
# - Security updates are always created regardless of schedule
# - PRs are automatically rebased when base branch is updated
# - Dependabot will not create PRs for dependencies with open PRs
# - Review and merge PRs promptly to keep dependencies up to date
