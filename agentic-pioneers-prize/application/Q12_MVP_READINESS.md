# Q12: MVP and Integration Readiness

**Word Limit**: 400 words
**Appendix**: REQUIRED (PDF, max 10MB, 2 A4 pages)
**Scored**: Yes (1-10 by 3 assessors)

---

## Official Prompt

> **Describe what aspects of your solution are ready for demonstration and how they can be deployed.**

---

## Must Explain

1. **The MVP scope delivered**, what can be demonstrated, and how this demonstrable capability aligns with your selected challenge statement and its objectives
2. **Packaging, APIs, interfaces** and deployment model validated during the phase
3. **Verification and validation results**, acceptance thresholds met and known limitations
4. **What remains to reach production** in a typical UK setting, and the plan to close gaps

---

## Scoring Criteria Summary

### For 9-10 Score (Target)
- Baseline and progression to MVP are clearly and convincingly described
- MVP is well-defined, coherent, and strongly aligned with challenge statement
- What can be demonstrated directly evidences progress against the challenge
- Evidence of testing, demonstration and deployment is strong and robust
- Packaging, interfaces and APIs are clearly described and credible
- V&V activities are substantial with clear acceptance thresholds
- Remaining gaps identified with realistic plans to close them
- Environmental and societal considerations addressed
- Appendix is clear and materially enhances understanding

### Avoid (3-4 Score Indicators)
- MVP is unclear or not credible
- Alignment with challenge statement is weak
- Minimal evidence of testing, demonstration or deployment
- V&V are weak, absent or inappropriate
- Remaining gaps largely unrecognised

## Appendix Requirements (REQUIRED)

**File**: `Q12_APPENDIX.pdf`
**Content**: Diagrams, summaries or tables that show what MVP does and how it can be deployed

**Suggested Content for Appendix**:
- [ ] MVP feature matrix (what's working vs planned)
- [ ] System deployment diagram
- [ ] API interface documentation
- [ ] Verification results table
- [ ] Screenshot of working UI
- [ ] Sample outputs (STEP file, analysis report examples)

---

## Key Messages (from OUR_APPROACH.md)

1. **Working end-to-end system** demonstrated
2. **Supports brackets, mounts, fixtures** (P1 component types)
3. **CAD generation + FEA analysis + documentation** pipeline complete
4. **Web-based interface** with 3D viewer operational

---

## Evidence to Include

- [ ] Screenshot of working UI
- [ ] Sample outputs (STEP file, analysis report)
- [ ] Verification results table
- [ ] List of features working vs planned
- [ ] Deployment model (web-based SaaS)
