# Q15: Future Potential and Scalability

**Word Limit**: 400 words
**Appendix**: None allowed
**Scored**: Yes (1-10 by 3 assessors)

---

## Official Prompt

> **How far do you think you can develop your solution?**

---

## Must Explain

1. **The technical roadmap** informed by the solution development phase
2. **Generalisability** to adjacent use cases or sectors, and limits to transfer
3. **Scaling considerations** for data, safety, compute, deployment and operations in UK settings
4. **Partnership, IP and commercial milestones** you will pursue post-competition

---

## Scoring Criteria Summary

### For 9-10 Score (Target)
- Roadmap is clear, evidence-informed and realistic
- Strong potential for wider application or generalisation
- Scaling considerations are well understood and addressed
- Next steps, partnerships or milestones are credible and aligned to opportunity

### For 7-8 Score
- Roadmap reasonable with some evidence
- Some discussion of generalisation or scale though less detailed
- Next steps clear but modest

### Avoid (3-4 Score Indicators)
- Roadmap lacks credibility or detail
- Scalability unexplored or unrealistic
- No meaningful next steps

---

## Key Messages (from OUR_APPROACH.md)

1. **Roadmap**: Brackets → assemblies → complex structures
2. **Cross-sector**: Marine, aerospace, energy applications
3. **Integration path**: Enterprise CAD/PLM systems
4. **UK exploitation**: UK IP ownership, exploit from UK

## Technical Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Scope |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Phase 2 (Current) | 3 months | Brackets, mounts, fixtures |
| Post-Competition Year 1 | 12 months | Extend to assemblies, more processes |
| Year 2-3 | 24 months | Complex structures, multi-domain |
| Long-term | 3-5 years | Full DfX ecosystem, enterprise integration |

---

## Generalisability

| Current Scope | Adjacent Applications | Limits |
|---------------|----------------------|--------|
| H2 Tank brackets | Wind turbine mounts | Not for rotating machinery |
| Static structural | Piping supports | Not for pressure vessels |
| CNC/sheet metal | Welded fabrication | Not for complex castings |
| SME users | Enterprise integration | Needs PLM integration |

## Scaling Considerations

| Aspect | Current | Scaled |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Data | Materials database for common materials | Expanded to all industrial materials |
| Safety | Manual V&V for each component type | Automated validation frameworks |
| Compute | Single instance | Multi-tenant cloud (AWS/Azure UK) |
| Deployment | Demo environment | Production SaaS |
| Operations | Founder-led | Dedicated support team |
