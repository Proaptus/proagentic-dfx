# Q11: User and Workflow Fit

**Word Limit**: 400 words
**Appendix**: Optional (PDF, max 10MB, 2 A4 pages)
**Scored**: Yes (1-10 by 3 assessors)

---

## Official Prompt

> **Who will use it, where does it fit in the workflow, and what does it improve?**

---

## Must Explain

1. **The real user context**, roles and tasks you are designing for, and any human-in-the-loop steps
2. **Potential implications** for time, quality, cost, safety or reliability in that workflow
3. **Interoperability** with existing tools, systems, data formats and governance constraints

---

## Scoring Criteria Summary

### For 9-10 Score (Target)
- User context and workflow described with strong domain understanding
- Clear insight into real tasks, constraints, dependencies and organisational practices
- Workflow integration is realistic, coherent and linked to challenge
- Human-in-the-loop roles are identified and well justified
- Interoperability with existing tools and governance is addressed credibly
- Assumptions about adoption are explicit and plausible
- Appendix enhances clarity, if submitted

### Avoid (3-4 Score Indicators)
- Limited or shallow understanding of users, roles or workflows
- Proposed integration into real-world processes is unclear or unrealistic
- Human-in-the-loop needs ignored or poorly justified
- Interoperability constraints not recognised

---

## Appendix Requirements (Optional)

**File**: `Q11_APPENDIX.pdf`
**Content**: Visuals that clarify user journey, workflow, or how solution fits into existing processes

**Suggested Content for Appendix**:
- [ ] User journey diagram
- [ ] Workflow integration diagram (before/after)
- [ ] User roles and responsibilities matrix
- [ ] Time savings comparison table
- [ ] Tool interoperability diagram (STEP output to CAD systems)

---

## Key Messages (from OUR_APPROACH.md)

1. **Target user**: Design engineers at manufacturing SMEs
2. **Fits after concept phase**, before detailed drawings
3. **Human-in-loop**: Engineer approves before manufacturing
4. **Reduces design time** from hours to minutes

---

## Evidence to Include

- [ ] Workflow diagram showing integration point
- [ ] Time savings quantified (hours → minutes)
- [ ] Interoperability: STEP output to any CAD system
- [ ] User feedback or testing results (if available)

## Answer Template

```
[DRAFT - 400 WORDS MAX]

### Target Users
[Describe who will use the system - design engineers at SMEs, their roles, typical tasks...]

### Workflow Integration
[Where does our system fit in their existing design process? After concept, before detail...]

### Human-in-the-Loop
[How do humans stay in control? Review points, approval gates, iteration...]

### Improvements Delivered
[Quantify time, quality, cost, safety improvements...]

### Interoperability
[How does it connect to existing tools? STEP files, CAD systems, PLM, documentation...]
```

- [ ] Identifies human-in-loop steps
- [ ] Quantifies improvements (time, quality, cost)
- [ ] Addresses interoperability with existing tools
- [ ] Acknowledges governance/constraints
- [ ] Under 400 words
