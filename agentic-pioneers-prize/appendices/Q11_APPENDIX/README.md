## Suggested Content

### Page 1: User Journey and Workflow

- [ ] **Current State vs Future State Diagram**
  - Before: Manual design process (hours/days)
  - After: ProAgentic DfX automated process (minutes)
  - Time savings highlighted

- [ ] **Workflow Integration Diagram**
  - Shows where our system fits in typical engineering workflow:
    1. Customer requirements received
    2. Concept design (manual)
    3. **ProAgentic DfX** ← Our insertion point
    4. Detail design review (human approval)
    5. Manufacturing
  - Human-in-the-loop checkpoints marked

### Page 2: User Context and Interoperability

- [ ] **User Roles Matrix**
  | Role | Tasks | How They Use System | Benefits |
  |------|-------|---------------------|----------|
  | Design Engineer | Create bracket designs | Input requirements, review options | 10x faster design |
  | Engineering Manager | Approve designs | Review analysis reports | Confidence in results |
  | Manufacturing Engineer | Plan production | Access DfM reports | Fewer manufacturing issues |

- [ ] **Interoperability Diagram**
  - STEP file output → Any CAD system (SolidWorks, Fusion, etc.)
  - PDF reports → Documentation systems
  - JSON data → PLM/ERP integration
  - Standards compliance → Audit/certification systems

- [ ] **Time Savings Comparison**
  | Design Type | Manual Process | With ProAgentic | Savings |
  |-------------|---------------|-----------------|---------|
  | Simple bracket | 4 hours | 15 minutes | 16x |
  | Complex mount | 2 days | 45 minutes | 21x |
  | Fixture design | 1 day | 30 minutes | 16x |

## Design Guidelines

- Use clear workflow arrows and boxes
- Before/after comparison is visually impactful
- Highlight time savings prominently
- Show human-in-the-loop points clearly
- Include user quotes or feedback if available
- Professional, clean design
