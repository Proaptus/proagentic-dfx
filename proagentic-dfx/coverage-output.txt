==========================================================================================
HOW TO FIX
==========================================================================================

1. CRITICAL - API Routes:
   Delete all files in src/app/api/ - these should ONLY exist in mock server

2. CRITICAL - Variable Naming:
   Remove hardcoded arrays. Data should come from props passed by parent
   components that fetch from API.

3. HIGH - Engineering Mock Values:
   These values must come from API endpoints like:
   - GET /api/designs/{id}/stress
   - GET /api/designs/{id}/failure
   - GET /api/designs/{id}/thermal

4. MEDIUM - Round Numbers & Perfect Data:
   Real data has noise. If you see perfect sequences, it's generated.

5. LOW - Status Strings:
   May be acceptable for enums/types, but review if data arrays use them.
