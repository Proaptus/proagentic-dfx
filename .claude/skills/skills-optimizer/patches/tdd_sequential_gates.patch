-### Step 1: Turn Task Into Tests (Test-First with Integration Tests PRIMARY)
+### Step 1: Turn Task Into Tests → 🔴 RED VALIDATION GATE (MANDATORY)
+
+**🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST COMPLETE THIS ENTIRE STEP BEFORE STEP 2. NO EXCEPTIONS.**
+
+**🚨 YOU CANNOT DO STEP 1 AND STEP 2 TOGETHER. THEY MUST BE SEQUENTIAL.**
+
+#### Step 1A: Write Tests ONLY (No Implementation Code)

 **Always generate tests BEFORE implementation.**
+
+**RULES FOR STEP 1A**:
+1. ✅ Write ONLY the test file
+2. ❌ Do NOT write any implementation code
+3. ❌ Do NOT edit the component/function being tested
+4. ❌ Do NOT run implementation commands
+
+**What you create in Step 1A**:
+- ONE test file (e.g., `tests/integration/ComponentName.test.tsx`)
+- Test cases that describe expected behavior
+- Assertions for what should happen
+
+**What you DO NOT create in Step 1A**:
+- Implementation code
+- Component changes
+- Function changes
+- Any fixes to make tests pass
+
+---
+
+#### Step 1B: 🔴 RED VALIDATION GATE - MANDATORY STOP POINT
+
+**🛑 YOU MUST RUN TESTS AND PROVE RED STATE BEFORE PROCEEDING TO STEP 2**
+
+**MANDATORY ACTIONS** (cannot be skipped):
+
+1. **RUN the test file you just created**:
+   ```bash
+   npm test -- tests/integration/YourTest.test.tsx --run
+   ```
+
+2. **CAPTURE the failure output** - Tests MUST FAIL:
+   ```
+   Expected output:
+   ❌ FAIL tests/integration/YourTest.test.tsx
+     ✗ your test name
+       Expected: [something]
+       Received: [current broken state]
+
+   Test Files  1 failed (1)
+   Tests  X failed (X)
+   ```
+
+3. **SHOW the evidence to the user**:
+   - Display the actual command you ran
+   - Display the actual failure output
+   - Point out which tests failed
+   - Explain why they failed (bug doesn't exist yet / feature not implemented)
+
+4. **STOP and CONFIRM RED state**:
+   - ✅ Tests have been executed
+   - ✅ Tests FAILED (RED confirmed)
+   - ✅ Evidence shown to user
+   - ✅ User can see the RED state
+
+**⚠️ IF TESTS PASS AT THIS POINT**: You wrote the tests incorrectly. Tests should FAIL because the bug/feature doesn't exist yet. Fix the tests to actually validate the requirement.
+
+**❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**:
+- Do NOT proceed to Step 2 without proving RED
+- Do NOT claim "tests would fail" without running them
+- Do NOT write implementation code yet
+- Do NOT assume RED state without evidence
+
+---
+
+**🛑 MANDATORY CHECKPOINT: You CANNOT proceed to Step 2 until RED state is proven above with actual command output shown to the user**

+
+**🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETED STEP 1 RED GATE BEFORE STARTING THIS STEP**
+
+**🚨 VERIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING**: Did you prove RED state in Step 1? If not, go back to Step 1B.
+
+#### Step 2A: Implement Minimal Fix (Only After RED Confirmed)

 **Fix ONE failing test at a time** using the self-debugging loop.
+
+**RULES FOR STEP 2A**:
+1. ✅ Now (and only now) edit the implementation file
+2. ✅ Make the SMALLEST change to fix the failing test
+3. ❌ Do NOT refactor yet (that's Step 4)
+4. ❌ Do NOT add extra features
+
+**What you change in Step 2A**:
+- The component/function being tested
+- ONLY what's needed to make test pass
+- Minimal code changes

+
+#### Step 2B: 🟢 GREEN VALIDATION GATE - MANDATORY STOP POINT
+
+**🛑 YOU MUST RUN TESTS AND PROVE GREEN STATE**
+
+**MANDATORY ACTIONS** (cannot be skipped):
+
+1. **RUN the SAME test file again**:
+   ```bash
+   npm test -- tests/integration/YourTest.test.tsx --run
+   ```
+
+2. **CAPTURE the success output** - Tests MUST PASS:
+   ```

+     ✓ your test name (XXXms)
+
+   Test Files  1 passed (1)
+   Tests  X passed (X)
+   ```
+
+3. **SHOW the evidence to the user**:
+   - Display the actual command you ran
+   - Display the actual success output
+   - Show that tests now PASS
+   - Explain the RED→GREEN transition
+
+4. **STOP and CONFIRM GREEN state**:
+   - ✅ Tests have been executed
+   - ✅ Tests PASSED (GREEN confirmed)
+   - ✅ Evidence shown to user
+   - ✅ User can verify RED→GREEN transition
+
+**⚠️ IF TESTS STILL FAIL**: Use self-debug loop (max 3 iterations), then show results. Do not proceed until GREEN.

+**❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**:
+- Do NOT proceed to Step 4 without proving GREEN
+- Do NOT claim "tests pass" without running them
+- Do NOT skip showing evidence
+- Do NOT assume GREEN state without proof

+**🚨 CRITICAL: YOU MUST HAVE COMPLETED STEP 2 GREEN GATE BEFORE REFACTORING**
+
+**🚨 VERIFY BEFORE PROCEEDING**: Did you prove GREEN state in Step 2? If not, go back to Step 2B.
+
+#### Step 4A: Make ONE Refactor at a Time

 **With tests passing**, improve code quality without breaking tests.
+
+**RULES FOR STEP 4A**:
+1. ✅ Identify ONE code smell or improvement
+2. ✅ Make ONE small refactor (do not batch changes)
+3. ✅ Do NOT change behavior
+4. ❌ Do NOT make multiple refactors before testing

+
+#### Step 4B: 🟢 GREEN MAINTENANCE GATE - MANDATORY STOP POINT
+
+**🛑 AFTER EACH REFACTOR, YOU MUST RUN TESTS AND PROVE STILL GREEN**
+
+**MANDATORY ACTIONS** (cannot be skipped, MUST repeat after EACH refactor):
+
+1. **RUN tests after this ONE refactor**:
+   ```bash
+   npm test -- tests/integration/YourTest.test.tsx --run
+   ```
+
+2. **CAPTURE the output** - Tests MUST STILL PASS:
+   ```
+   Expected output:
+   ✓ PASS tests/integration/YourTest.test.tsx
+     ✓ your test name (XXXms)
+
+   Test Files  1 passed (1)
+   Tests  X passed (X)
+   ```
+
+3. **VERIFY no regressions**:
+   - Tests still pass after refactor
+   - No new failures introduced
+   - Behavior unchanged
+
+4. **IF TESTS FAIL**: Revert the refactor immediately, it broke something
+
+5. **REPEAT this gate** for next refactor (one refactor → one test run → repeat)
+
+**❌ FORBIDDEN ACTIONS**:
+- Do NOT make multiple refactors before testing
+- Do NOT batch refactors together
+- Do NOT skip testing after each refactor
+- Do NOT assume tests still pass without running them

+**🚨 CRITICAL CHANGE: REMOVE ALL PARALLEL EXECUTION**
+
 ### Before TDD Loop:
 1. **Sequential Thinking**: Analyze task, plan test strategy
 2. **Context7**: Verify testing best practices for frameworks

 ### During TDD Loop:
-3. **Task Tool**: Parallelize test generation for multiple scenarios
-4. **Sequential Thinking**: Self-debug loop (analyze → fix → verify)
+3. **Sequential Execution ONLY**: NO parallel task execution
+4. **Mandatory Gates**: STOP at each validation gate
 5. **Context7**: Validate implementations against library patterns
